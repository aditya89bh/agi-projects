# AGI Projects Research Repository

This repository contains implementations of cutting-edge AGI and sparse neural network research.

## Project 1: Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET) ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Successfully implemented with 98.33% MNIST accuracy using only 5% active connections

### Results
- **Accuracy**: 98.33% on MNIST dataset
- **Sparsity**: 95% reduction in parameters (139,700/2,794,000 active)
- **Evolution**: Dynamic topology changes every 100 epochs
- **Architecture**: 3-layer MLP with biological neural plasticity

### Features
- Erdős–Rényi sparse initialization
- Automatic pruning of weak connections
- Random regrowth of new pathways
- Real-time sparsity monitoring

## Next Projects (Coming Soon)
- Memory-Augmented Transformer for Few-shot Learning
- Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)
- Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Vision Transformers
- Sparse Mixture-of-Experts
