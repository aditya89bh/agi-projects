# Sparse Mixture-of-Experts with Expert Choice Routing

A PyTorch implementation of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Expert Choice Routing for efficient neural network scaling. This project demonstrates the key concepts and provides a working implementation suitable for research and educational purposes.

## üéØ Overview

Traditional Mixture-of-Experts models use **token choice routing**, where each token selects which experts to use. This implementation features **Expert Choice Routing**, where experts select which tokens to process, leading to:

- Better load balancing across experts
- More stable training dynamics  
- Improved computational efficiency
- Reduced communication overhead in distributed settings

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Key Components

1. **ExpertChoiceRouter**: Implements the core routing mechanism where experts choose tokens
2. **SparseExpertChoiceMoE**: The main MoE layer with load balancing
3. **TransformerWithMoE**: Complete transformer architecture incorporating MoE layers
4. **Training & Analysis Tools**: Utilities for training and analyzing expert utilization

### Expert Choice Routing

```python
# Traditional: Tokens choose experts
token_to_expert = select_top_k_experts(router_logits)

# Expert Choice: Experts choose tokens  
expert_to_tokens = select_top_k_tokens_per_expert(router_logits)
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

# Study impact on expert utilization
```

## üìö Key Concepts

### Expert Choice vs Token Choice

**Token Choice (Traditional MoE):**
- Each token selects top-k experts
- Can lead to load imbalance
- Experts may be underutilized

**Expert Choice (This Implementation):**  
- Each expert selects top-k tokens
- Guarantees expert utilization
- Better load balancing

### Load Balancing
The auxiliary loss encourages uniform expert usage:

```python
load_balance_loss = MSE(expert_counts, uniform_target)
total_loss = main_loss + Œª * load_balance_loss
```

### Computational Benefits
- **Sparse Activation**: Only a fraction of experts process each token
- **Predictable Compute**: Each expert processes exactly `capacity` tokens
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Even workload distribution

## üî¨ Research Extensions

### Possible Improvements
1. **Dynamic Expert Capacity**: Adjust capacity based on input complexity
2. **Hierarchical Experts**: Multi-level expert selection
3. **Cross-Attention Routing**: Use attention mechanisms for routing
4. **Learned Load Balancing**: Replace auxiliary loss with learned balancing

### Applications
- Large language models
- Computer vision transformers  
- Multimodal architectures
- Federated learning systems
